  <h4>Late Policy</h4>
  <p>
    Students start the semester with a total of 5 late days, which provide
    an extra 24 hours each. You may use up to 2 late days on an assignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    If (and only if) you submit an assignment more than 2 days late or are out
    of late days, there is a 20% penalty per day beyond the late day extension.

  <h4>Collaboration, Online Resources &amp; Academic Integrity</h4>
  <p>In the spirit of open-source software, we highly encourage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharing of resources</li>
    <li>Sharing of inspiration</li>
    <li>Sharing these things on Piazza</li>
    <li>Helping out classmates on Piazza</li>
    <li>Collaboration at a low level (<em>Hey, what's the syntax for matches, again? Why does a loop borrow its iterator?</em>)</li>
    <li>Collaboration at a high level (<em>Why did they tell us to do this that way? How does the borrow checker work?</em>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As in most CIS courses, the internet is your friend. Rust is a community
    born to the internet. You are expected and encouraged to find resources
    online that will help you learn the material and complete the assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should not share large amounts of code with others in the course
    (except on group projects). You should not discuss the exact solutions to
    mid-level programming problems. You should not be asking a stranger to
    finish your work for you or copying and pasting what you find online for
    submission. Use common sense. This course strictly follows the University's
    <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html">Code of Academic Integrity</a>.
