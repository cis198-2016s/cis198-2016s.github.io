  is a new, practical, community-developed systems programming language that
  "runs blazingly fast, prevents almost all crashes, and eliminates data
  races." Rust derives from a rich history of languages to create a
  multi-paradigm (imperative/functional), low-level language that focuses on
  high-performance, zero-cost safety guarantees in concurrent programs. It
  began to gain traction in industry even before its official 1.0 release
  in May 2015, showing a recognized need for a new low-level systems
  language.

  In this course, we will cover what makes Rust so unique and apply it to
  practical systems programming problems. Topics covered will include traits
  and generics; memory safety (move semantics, borrowing, and lifetimes);
  Rust’s rich macro system; closures; and concurrency. Evaluation is based on
  regular homework assignments as well as a final project and class
  participation.
